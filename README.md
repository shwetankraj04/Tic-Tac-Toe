# Tic Tac Toe
 This Tic Tac Toe game is a classic implementation developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game offers a fun and interactive way for two players to compete, taking turns to mark their symbols on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
